I'm currently an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at Hunter College. I specialize in web technologies 
but also interested in expanding my knowledge towards mobile app development and data science. 

### More Information

When I'm not coding, I like to hang out with friends and catch up on their lives, play handball/volleyball, go biking, and have a good time.
