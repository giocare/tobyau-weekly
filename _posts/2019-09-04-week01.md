### Why did I decide to take a course in Open Source software? 

~~To be completely honest, I decided to take Open Source because Machine Learning was filled.~~
#### However, Open Source was still on my bucket list along with Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science.

From my experience interning as a software developer and participating in hackathons, I found that I enjoy contributing to people's projects because it's a great opportunity to learn their problem solving and programming skills. 

I'm excited to expand my knowledge about Open Source software!
