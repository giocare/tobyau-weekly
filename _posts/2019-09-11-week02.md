### What types of contributions do you think are suitable choices for you to make as your first contributions to an open source project? 

Initially, I was thinking about editing documentation and fixing bugs but soon realized that programming is a larger hurdle than I anticipated. 

Prior to reading [How to Contribute to Open Source Without Coding](https://icontribute.wordpress.com/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-coding/), I had no idea that sending the programmers post cards or a virtual beer is considered a contribution. There seems to be many ways to contribute to open source projects without programming. With that in mind, as my first contributions I would like to take on something light and beginner friendly like:
* editing user documentation
* make comments on how to improve the quality of the program
* submit bug reports. 

Given the opportunity, I would also like to help maintain a website for an Open Source project. 

### What types of projects interest you and how do you see your relationship to them?
