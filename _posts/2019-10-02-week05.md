title: Week 5 ~ Exploring Open Source Projects and Git Workflow
---
<br>

**`Finding a project.`**  

Section 4 of [GitHub's How To Contribute](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to) tried to motivate beginners to take initiative on contributing to open source projects. The easiest contribution to ease your way into open source seems like fixing a typo or errors in documentation such as the README. Ultimately the easiest contribution is based on the contributors preference, so it is up for debate. This section provides multiple resources to help people discover open source projects. 
- [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore/)
- [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/)
- [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
- [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
- [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/)
- [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/)
- [Contributor-ninja](https://contributor.ninja/)
- [First Contributions](https://firstcontributions.github.io/)
- [SourceSort](https://www.sourcesort.com/)

GitHub Explore and SourceSort are very useful in terms of narrowing down which open source projects cater to your preferences. GitHub Explore shows a list of projects that are catered to your github activity. SourceSort has filter options that let you apply filters to the projects that you're looking for and will display the results as cards with sufficient details about those projects.

**`Course related activity for the week`**

My team and I applied best Git and Github practices using [Collaboration Workflow Presentation](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci395.86/slides/github-workflow-presentation.pdf) as a reference to the in-class Git activty called "Git Workflow Activity-01". My teammates nominated me as the "maintainer" due to my Git experience. Although I was reluctant to take on this role, it made sense since I had the most Git experience. This activity involved creating a repository on Github, forking it into our personal Github accounts, contributing to the remote repository from their local machine, and creating issues to repeat the contribution process.
