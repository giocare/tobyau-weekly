title: Week 4 ~ My experience and reaction with the Git activities and the assigned reading.

### Thoughts about the Git Assignments

Working on the Git assignments with 3 other students was refreshing because it was reminiscent of when I first started learning Git. This assignment required us to push our changes to a remote repository in the master branch. I had experience working with Git and soon found out my teammates were experienced as well so we were able to finish the assignment a little faster than expected. However, it wasn't always smooth sailing. I encountered some merge conflicts when pushing changes to the team README file because it had been modified by my teammates. A little pull here and a merge there resolved the merge conflicts.

Another Git activity I worked on involved making an edit to a classmate's blog post following the procedure described in the [Blog Editing Activity](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci395.86/activities_f19/blog_editing_activity.pdf). The edits can range from spelling or grammatical mistakes, or formatting suggestions. 
Some steps I took to making an edit: 
1. I read through a classmates blog post to look for changes
2. After finding a spelling mistake, I opened an issue on their repository
3. Forked their repo 
4. Cloned the forked repo to my local machine 
5. Fixed the spelling mistake on VS Code (a text editor of my choice) 
6. Add changes, commit, and push the changes to my fork 
7. Finally, create the pull request 

This procedure is simplier than the one we discussed in class since we didn't have to create a separate branch. 

### Thoughts about the assigned reading.

Post: "[A Beginner’s Very Bumpy Journey Through The World of Open Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginners-very-bumpy-journey-through-the-world-of-open-source-4d108d540b39/)"

The author, Shubheksha, of this post gave an honest and intimate back story of when he first started approaching open source. I couldn't help but empathize with him about his struggles with unsupportive mentors that stagnated his growth in the open source community. This situation is what I think most beginners fear the most, that they're not good enough to contribute. He mentioned a few tips that really resonated with me. They were simple but it was a much needed emphasis in order to move forward and progress.
1. Don't be afraid to ask questions.
2. It's OK to have holes in your knowledge.
